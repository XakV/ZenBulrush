Bulrush
=======

A [Bulma][1]-based [Pelican][2] blog theme; clean, flexible and responsive.

The icons are from [Font Awesome][3] by Dave Gandy. The pure HTML/CSS "Fork me
on GitHub" ribbon is based on [`github-fork-ribbon-css`][4] by Simon Whitaker; I
modified it to be flatter.

Features
--------

**Key**: ☐ Planned ☑ Delivered ☒ Not planned

**☑ Responsive design** - four column layout on desktop (≥980px), three column
on tablet (≥769px), single column on mobile. Tabbed navigation bar collapses
into drop-down "burger menu" on mobile.

**☐ Meta tagging functionality** - support for [Open Graph][5] and [Twitter
Cards][6] meta tags, giving enhanced display when sharing articles on social
media sites.
